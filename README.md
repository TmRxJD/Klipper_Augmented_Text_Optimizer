# Text_Colorizer
Easily colorize any output text in Klipper. You can specify colors for the text and background and color them by letter or word. An example of proper syntax would be as follows: "text_colorizer message="All praise be to Jinjahovah" text_colors=blue,red,green,orange bg_colors=black,none,cyan by_word=true"
